background: "
In early 2023, we had some improvements in the product page. We did some redesign and rearranged some buttons/features on the product page.
<br/><br/>
The redesign had three main objectives. Firstly, it aimed to improve the information infrastructure on the product page. Secondly, it involved rebranding the product to align with the latest theme of the current Website. Thirdly, the changes were implemented to enhance development scalability.
<br/><br/>
The primary focus was to address the first objective, with the intention of driving conversion rates and class sales. This was prompted by the fact that the previous product page had roughly a 12% conversion to add cart. The introduction of the new product page is expected to increase the conversion to add to cart and ultimately improve conversion rates, leading to user purchases.
"
goal: "
Currently, we are monitoring the performance of the new landing page using quantitative analysis methods. The purpose of this monitoring is to assess the current performance and identify areas for improvement in the new landing page. Our goal is to enhance the user experience and boost conversion rates.
"
conclussion: "
The new design has a lower ads budget but seems to be more effective in converting users, it shows that even though the traffic is far below the old design, the cost of acquisition is lower than the old design.
