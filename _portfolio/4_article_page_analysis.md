Do they have the opportunity to convert in the sense of visiting our product landing page or not? If yes, not maybe’re not good enough on offering our product to the visitor, or maybe visitor read the articles not until our product landing page recommendation, so they’re not aware that we offer a related product with the article.

From 1% of user who are not leaving our article immediately, I did some reaserch of that user, are they really read our articles? Are they finished reading the article or not? Turns out, we know that on a weekly average, 45% of the visitor are reading up until 25% of the page depth and the rest 45% are reading until 50% of the page depth. Means only roughly 10% visitor are reading the article until 75% .

Article I is an article that has a good conversion to the next journey, which is 97.14% of them continue to read another article. But their activity stopped there. They’re not moving to the next journey and just leave our platform.

The article that have a huge engagement from visitor is Article A. On that article, Visitor will get a banner and article recommendation related to the article topic when they reach 25% of the page depth. While on the article I, the user will get a banner and the next article recommendation after they reach 50% of the page depth. Meanwhile, the content recommendation for Content I as well is not really relevant with the article topic.
