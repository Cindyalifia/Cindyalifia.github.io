This analysis is align with the first analysis. We have an old design and a new design for some of our products. For the old design, we rearranged some features and made it more of a compact design. 
<br/><br/>
The first analysis shows that the new design performs better in terms of ads spending because it has a lower customer acquisition. But instead of creating a new design each time, we feel that we need some improvement on the features/buttons on the product page, we want to analyze which buttons/features are giving a huge engagement and have a big potential for users to convert, so we can approach some users that already use some important features on our landing page product, and follow up the user to convert.

"
goal: "
We know what features are the most important and how to improve another less important feature. We also can follow up with users who already use our important feature but have not converted yet.
"
conclussion: "
<ul>
<li>Improvement in the add to cart button are works, we add the add to cart button in the sticky sidebar and in the sticky footer, showing we have an improvement in the Add to Cart CTR button. Meanwhile, it seems that users tend to purchase on the mobile site.</li>
<li>Another improvement is on the free tutorial video registration who is having lower registration rate and also conversion rate. This is because of we put the form in the 75% of the page depth, than the old design is in the 50% of the page depth.</li>
</ul>

- #### Call Us Button

|            | Call Us button above the fold | Call Us button under Pricing Section |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Old Design | CTR = 15.2% Conversion = 8.2% | CTR = 8% Conversion = 5%             |
| New Design | CTR = 10.5% Conversion =9.25% | CTR = 4% Conversion = 2.1%           |

Considering these findings, the new design shows potential in terms of conversion rates for users who clicked the "Call Us" option. Therefore, we can conclude that **there is a big potential for the call us button**, which can push and make users more interested in our product and convert.

- #### Add to Cart Button

|                  | Add to Cart   Pricing Detail | Add to Cart   Sticky Sidebar [Desktop] | Add to Cart  Sticky Footer [Mobile] |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CTR & Conversion | CTR = 9% Conversion = 0%     | CTR = 6% Conversion = 0%               | CTR = 18% Conversion = 11%          |

We also adding a new add to cart button, which is in the Sticky Sidebar for desktop user and in the sticky footer for mobile user. It’s obvious that the add to cart in the sticky sidebar is 0%, showing that the button works but users tend to purchase on the mobile site rather than desktop. One thing we also can notice is user on mobile have a bigger potential to convert than on the desktop. Another thing is that even though we show the add to cart button in the pricing detail, users are more likely to click the button from the sidebar and footer.

- #### Free Tutorial Video Registration

|            | Total User Register | Conversion from User Register |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Old Design | 74%    | 16.3%              |
| New Design | 52%    | 10.5%              |

We can see that free tutorial video registration button works for the Old Design, but somehow, it’s decreasing in the New Design. After comparing the design, turns out free tutorial video for the new design is in the 75% of the page depth, while in the old design, it’s below the pricing detail which is around 50% of the page depth.
