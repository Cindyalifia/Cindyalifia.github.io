Hi, My name is Cindy Alifia Putri, I work as a Data Analyst. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Informatics Engineering (Telkom University 2016-2020). I always been in love with Mathematics since I was in Elementary School when I can solve variable x in a linear question for the first time ðŸ˜‚. Since that, Iâ€™ve been really enjoying myself solving math problems. Long story short, I finally decide to pick Informatics Engineering as my subject that I want to learn more.

I have been working as a Data Analyst for almost 3.5 years, and Iâ€™m still enjoying myself solving a data issue, make a correlation between one insight and another, find the data pattern and etc, and still eager to learn more about data. The more I learn about the data in a company, the more Iâ€™m sure that the data itâ€™s self is a mess! Believing on that point, make me more exited to help and thinking of the strategy on the data standarization and data mart (especially on how we design an event tracker).

If we get a better data collection, we can think on how to make these data more powerful for us to think what metric we want to track, whatâ€™s the successful user do in our platform in regards on purchasing our product, and what failed user do in our platform. From that point of view, we can create a better and impactful insight to support the company business.
